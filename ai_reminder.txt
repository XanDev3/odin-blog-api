# Deep Dive Reminder

This document summarizes the steps taken and knowledge gathered during our analysis of the blog API project. It serves as a reminder in case of any interruptions or the need to revisit the project.

**I. Initial Project Information:**

*   **Project Type:** Express.js API for a blog.
*   **Data Persistence:** MongoDB with Mongoose.
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
*   **User Roles:** Two roles:
    *   Readers (public access).
    *   Editors/Admins (full CRUD access).
*   **Clients:** Two separate client repositories:
    *   `odin-blog-read-client` (for readers).
    *   `odin-blog-edit-client` (for editors/admins).
*   **User Management:** Handled within `authController.js`.
*   **Goal:** Improve the API with better visualization using Swagger and potentially implement basic rate limiting.
*   **swagger.md:** A new file named `swagger.md` to hold the Swagger documentation.
* **No userController:** There is no user controller, all actions for users are done within `authController.js`

**II. Deep Dive - Initial Steps:**

*   **Request:** User requested a deep dive into the repository as an expert API developer.
*   **Expertise:** Focus on TypeScript, JavaScript, Express.js, JWT, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
*   **Research:** Conducted research on all relevant technologies.
*   **Goal:** Gain a thorough understanding of the project without making immediate changes.
*   **Plan:**
    *   Analyze file structure.
    *   Identify dependencies.
    *   Understand core logic and functionality.
    *   Map API endpoints.
    *   Trace data flow.
    *   Investigate error handling.
    *   Assess security considerations.
*   **Clarifying Questions:** Asked initial clarifying questions about specific areas of focus, testing, and performance.

**III. Deep Dive - Refined Approach:**

*   **New Information:** Provided links to client repositories and clarified user roles/permissions.
*   **Adjusted Focus:**
    *   Prioritized authentication/authorization logic in `authController.js`.
    *   Focused on CRUD operations in `postController.js` and `commentController.js`.
    *   Analyzed data relationships in Mongoose models.
    *   Considered client interactions.
*   **Swagger Integration:** Began researching Swagger implementation with Express.js, including `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-express`.
*   **Clarifying Questions:** Asked further questions about specific admin endpoints, rate limiting, error responses, protected paths, admin role definition, documentation location, and naming conventions.

**IV. Deep Dive - Detailed Findings:**

*   **File Structure:** Well-organized, with logical separation of concerns (controllers, models, routes, config).
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `Express.js`
    *   `Mongoose`
    *   `jsonwebtoken`
    * `cookie-parser`
    *   `cors`
    *   `dotenv`
    * `bcrypt`
*   **Core Logic:**
    *   `app.js`: Sets up Express.js, uses middleware, defines routes, handles errors.
    *   `routes/`: `index.js` (basic route), `api.js` (API routes).
    *   `controllers/`: `authController.js` (user auth), `postController.js` (post CRUD), `commentController.js` (comment CRUD).
    *   `models/`: `user.js` (user schema), `post.js` (post schema), `comment.js` (comment schema).
    * `config/`: `allowedOrigins.js` (allowed origins), `corsOptions.js` (cors options).
    * `bin/www`: starts the server.
* **Security:**
    * JWT is being used.
    * Passwords are being hashed using bcrypt.
    * Cors is setup.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/api/signup` (public)
    *   `/api/login` (public)   
    *   `/api/logout` (public)    
    *   `/api/posts` (GET: public, POST: protected)
    *   `/api/posts/:id` (GET: public, PUT/DELETE: protected)
    *   `/api/posts/:id/comments` (GET: public)
    *   `/api/posts/:id/comments` (POST: protected)
    *   `/api/posts/:id/comments/:commentId` (GET: public)
    *   `/api/posts/:id/comments/:commentId` (PUT: protected)
    *   `/api/posts/:id/comments/:commentId` (GET: public, PUT/DELETE: protected)
    *  `/api/posts/:id/comments/:commentId` (DELETE: protected)

    *   `/api` (GET: public)
    * `/` (GET: public)
*   **Data Flow:** Standard Express.js pattern (routes -> controllers -> models -> database).
*   **Error Handling:** Try/catch blocks in controllers, custom error-handling middleware.
* **Environment:**
    * The config files are being used and setup correctly.
*   **Rate Limiting Research:**
    *   Identified `express-rate-limit` as a suitable library.
    *   Determined implementation would be relatively easy.
    *   Best placement would be after the `cors` middleware and before the routes.
*   **Swagger Progress:**
    *   Started `swagger.md` file.
    * Began documenting endpoints and schemas.
    * Working title for the swagger document is `API Documentation` or `Odin Blog API Documentation`.
*   **Clarifying Questions:**
    *   **Admin Endpoints:** No specific admin endpoints; admin access is based on the `isAdmin` flag.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Not currently implemented; `express-rate-limit` is a good option.
    *   **Error Handling:** Controller-based error handling, to be reflected in Swagger.
    *   **Protected Paths:** Most routes are protected by JWT.
    *   **Admin Role:** Defined by the `isAdmin` flag in the user model.


**V. Decisions Made:**

*   **Swagger UI:** Will use `swagger-ui-express`.
* **No User Controller:** There will not be a user controller.
* **Admin:** An admin will be determined by the `isAdmin` flag on the user model.
* **Cors:** Cors is setup correctly.
* **Security:** The current security measures are appropriate.
* **Naming:** The naming in the project is appropriate.

*   **Rate Limiting:** Will likely use `express-rate-limit` if requested.
**VI. Next Steps:**

*  **Swagger Documentation Complete:** We have now fully documented all the routes in `config/swagger.js`, including:
    *   All public routes (GET /api, GET /api/posts, GET /api/posts/:postid, GET `/api/posts/:postid/comments`, GET `/api/posts/:postid/comments/:commentid`, POST /api/signup, POST /api/login).
    *   All admin-protected routes (POST /api/posts, PUT /api/posts/:postid, DELETE /api/posts/:postid, PUT /api/posts/:postid/comments/:commentid, DELETE /api/posts/:postid/comments/:commentid).
    *   All user-protected routes (POST /api/posts/:postid/comments)
    * The new logout route (POST /api/logout)
* **User-Protected Route Identification:** We correctly identified all of the user protected routes.
* **Swagger UI Testing Plan:** We have created a very thorough testing plan to test all of the work we have been doing.
* Continue to document the endpoints and schemas in the swagger.md file.
* Wait for approval to implement rate limiting.
* Verify the functionality of the project to determine if there are any vulnurabilites.
